TopdownL1:
  Backend_Bound
       [This category represents fraction of slots where no uops are being delivered due to a lack of required resources for accepting new uops in the Backend]
  Bad_Speculation
       [This category represents fraction of slots wasted due to incorrect speculations]
  Frontend_Bound
       [This category represents fraction of slots where the processor's Frontend undersupplies its Backend]
  Retiring
       [This category represents fraction of slots utilized by useful work i.e. issued uops that eventually get retired]
